# Contributing to Interactive Math & Physics Explorations

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this educational project! We welcome contributions that help make mathematical and physical concepts more accessible through interactive visualizations.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create an issue with:
- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Browser and device information
- Screenshots (if applicable)

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for:
- New mathematical or physics concepts to visualize
- Improvements to existing projects
- Better user interface designs
- Performance optimizations
- Educational content improvements

### Adding New Projects

When adding a new interactive project:

1. **Choose a suitable topic** that can be effectively visualized
2. **Create a new directory** under `maths/` or `physics/`
3. **Follow the structure**:
   ```
   your-project-name/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css (if needed)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js (if needed)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (optional)
   ```

4. **Project Requirements**:
   - Must be educational and interactive
   - Should work in modern browsers
   - Must be responsive (mobile-friendly)
   - Should include clear explanations
   - Must be self-contained (no external dependencies if possible)

5. **Update the main navigation**:
   - Add your project to `index.html`
   - Include appropriate description and emoji
   - Update the project count if needed

6. **Update documentation**:
   - Add your project to the main `README.md`
   - Categorize it appropriately

### Code Style Guidelines

#### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper meta tags
- Ensure accessibility (alt tags, ARIA labels)
- Use meaningful class and ID names

#### CSS
- Use modern CSS (flexbox, grid)
- Make designs responsive
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Comment complex styles
- Avoid inline styles

#### JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ features
- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle errors gracefully
- Optimize for performance
